## OBS-web-playout

This is a client-side web app using the obs-websocket-js to provide a simple playout functionality on OBS.

### Features

- React based; therefore, it can be used on any modern browser
- works best if used locally

### Instructions

​	Make sure you have the following:

- OBS
- OBS-websocket

1. Create a scene called "Playout"
2. add 2 *ffmpeg_source*/Media sources with distinct names
3. Launch OBS and use client and the settings dialogue should come up
4. Add the necessary names to the web app (Playout scene name, media 1 source name, media 2 source name, *default media file)
5. Hit connect and you should be ready to go.


\* Since browsers does not support giving the full path of the files to web pages, the folder path containing the media must be manually put in.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
